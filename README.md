Iâ€™m a PH.D. candidate from Nanjing University of Science & Technology
(NUST), Nanjing, P.R China, supervised by Prof. Chuancai Liu. major on
artificial intelligence & pattern recognition, and now I'm studying in
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as a visiting
student working in the CASCAD Lab , supervised by Prof. Wai-Tat Fu.

My research interests broadly lie in the fields of machine learning,
crowdsourcing and social computing. I'm also an experienced web
developer as a fan of Ruby on Rails, AngularJs, etc.

BTW, I'm enthusiastic about testing.
